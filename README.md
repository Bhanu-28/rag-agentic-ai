# IBM RAG AND GENERATIVE AI

Description: https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/ibm-rag-and-agentic-ai

# Foundations of Generative AI and prompt Engineering

 This hands-on course is designed for aspiring AI developers, machine learning engineers, data scientists, AI researchers, or someone in a related role.

### **Pre-requisites**

Python programming skills and experience are essential for this course, as it dives straight into coding and application development. Fundamental AI and web development knowledge are highly recommended. 

### Next Evolution of AI

Retrieval Augmented Generation, or RAG, enhances AI's ability to provide accurate, context-aware responses by integrating real-time information retrieval. 

Multimodal AI is another advancement that allows systems to process and integrate various types of data – text, images, audio, and video – enabling more dynamic and interactive user experiences. 

Agentic AI represents a further shift, equipping systems with the ability to reason, plan, and autonomously execute tasks. 

While each of these approaches can work independently, they can also be combined to create more powerful and adaptable AI systems. 

welcome to the **Develop Generative AI Applications:** 

This course is part of the

- LLMs (Llama 3, Granite, Mixtral) to experiment with different AI models, compare their performance, and select the best fit for specific applications
- Python for coding AI applications, integrating APIs, and implementing LangChain's functionalities effectively

The creative skills of generative AI come from generative AI models such as generative adversarial networks or GANs, variational autoencoders or VAEs, transformers, and diffusion models. 

These models can be considered as the building blocks of generative AI. 

For instance, you have ChatGPT and Gemini for text generation, DALL-E2 and MidJourney for image generation, Synthesia for video generation, and Copilot and AlphaCode for 

code generation. 

And even though these models are trained to perform at its core a generation task, predicting the next word in the sentence, we actually can take these models and if you introduce a small amount of label data to the equation, you can tune them to perform traditional NLP tasks, things like classification or named entity recognition, things that you don't normally associate as being a generative based model or capability. This process is called tuning, where you can tune your foundation model by introducing a small amount of data, you update the parameters of your model, and now I can perform a very specific natural language task. If you don't have data or have only very few data points, you can still take these foundation models and they actually work very well in low label data domains.
