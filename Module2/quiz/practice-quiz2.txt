Create a chain with the pipe operator → Define variables → Build a PromptTemplate → Invoke with input values 



Invoke with input values → Define a template with variables → Create a PromptTemplate → Build a chain with the pipe operator 



Define a template with variables → Create a PromptTemplate → Build a chain using the pipe operator → Invoke with input values 



Create a PromptTemplate → Build a chain with the pipe operator → Define a template with variables → Invoke with input values 


Correct
This represents the proper sequence for creating an LCEL pattern, starting with defining the template structure and ending with invoking the completed chain.

chain = prompt_template.connect(llm).connect(output_parser) 



chain = prompt_template >> llm >> output_parser



chain = [prompt_template, llm, output_parser] 



chain = prompt_template | llm | output_parser 


Correct
LCEL uses the pipe (|) operator to connect components in a chain, allowing for a more intuitive and functional programming approach.
