Discriminative models handle unsupervised learning and generative models require labels.



Discriminative models copy data patterns and generative models ignore structure.



Discriminative models generate new outputs and generative models narrow down categories.


Correct
Discriminative models model the boundary between classes, while generative models model how data is generated through data distributions.
