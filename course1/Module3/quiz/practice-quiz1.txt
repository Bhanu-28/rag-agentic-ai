Question 2
Sarah is building an AI-powered application for DataSync Inc. that will process customer support tickets and return structured data for their workflow system. What techniques should she focus on when crafting prompts to ensure consistent, valid JSON outputs from the language model?


Using complex language 



Crafting prompts that clearly articulate the use case and problem



Focusing on the model's training data



Ignoring the model's guardrails


Correct
Crafting clear prompts ensures that the application generates reliable and actionable JSON responses by accurately capturing the use case.


3.
Question 3
Mark, a developer at InnovateTech, has shortlisted several AI models for a business application. How should he identify the most suitable model for the use case?


Use the same prompt to test different models



Rely on the model with the fastest response time



Choose the model based on its popularity



Select the smallest model to reduce costs


Correct
Testing models with the same prompt helps compare how well each fits the use case.

Question 4
Emily, a developer at CodeSolutions, is evaluating Llama 3, Granite, and Mixtral for integration into a new application. What should she consider when choosing the most suitable model?


Evaluate model performance, accuracy, and reliability



Rely on the model's documentation quality



Select the model with the fastest response time



Choose the model with the largest number of features


Correct
Evaluating performance, accuracy, and reliability helps choose the most suitable model for the application.


5.
Question 5
Lucas, a developer at DataGen, is experimenting with different prompting techniques. Which technique involves providing examples to guide the AI's responses?


Random prompting



Chain of thought prompting



Few shot prompting



Zero-shot prompting


Correct
This technique provides example input-output pairs to guide the model's responses.
