Use random prompting to diversify model responses



Fine-tune the model with domain-specific data



Use prompt chaining instead of data customization



Rely on zero-shot prompting for every task


Correct
Fine-tuning lets the model internalize domain-specific behavior and respond more accurately in context.

Question 7
Layla is building an AI application that needs to access proprietary company information not present in her LLM's training data. She's deciding between implementing RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) or fine-tuning the model. Which statement correctly describes the difference between these approaches?

RAG modifies the model's weights to incorporate new information, while fine-tuning passes relevant documents with each query 



Fine-tuning is ideal for frequently changing information, while RAG works best with static knowledge bases



Fine-tuning is cheaper than RAG because it requires less computational resources at query time 



RAG retrieves relevant information at query time and includes that information in the prompt, while fine-tuning updates the model's internal knowledge so it can provide domain specific answers every time.


Correct
RAG dynamically fetches relevant information and includes it in prompts without changing the model itself, while fine-tuning actually modifies the model's parameters to incorporate new knowledge.
