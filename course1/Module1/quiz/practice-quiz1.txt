Question 1
Sarah is a data scientist at a mid-sized company. She wants to implement a model that can handle multiple NLP tasks with minimal labeled data. Which approach should she consider using?


Using a small dataset to train a new model from scratch



Developing a rule-based system



Training a separate model for each task



Using a foundation model with tuning


Correct
Foundation models can be tuned with minimal labeled data to perform various NLP tasks.


2.
Question 2
Which of the following best describes the Natural Language Understanding (NLU) process in Natural Language Processing (NLP)?


Generating human-like responses to text inputs



Converting structured data into unstructured text



Translating unstructured text into structured data



Analyzing the grammatical structure of sentences


Correct
 This correctly describes NLU, which  involves converting unstructured text into structured data.


3.
Question 3
A company wants to implement a system to predict customer behavior patterns using past data. Which AI approach should they focus on?


Generative AI



Machine learning



Rule-based AI



Expert systems


Correct
Machine learning is ideal for this scenario as it excels at identifying patterns in data and making predictions.


4.
Question 4
How do discriminative and generative models fundamentally differ in how they learn from data?


Discriminative models focus on decision boundaries and generative models capture data distributions.



Discriminative models handle unsupervised learning and generative models require labels.



Discriminative models copy data patterns and generative models ignore structure.



Discriminative models generate new outputs and generative models narrow down categories.


Correct
Discriminative models model the boundary between classes, while generative models model how data is generated through data distributions.

Question 5
Emma must implement a Natural Language Processing system to convert spoken language into structured data. Which process within NLP primarily translates spoken or written text into a structured format?


Tokenization



Natural Language Generation (NLG)



Named Entity Recognition



Natural Language Understanding (NLU)


Correct
NLU is responsible for converting unstructured text into a structured format that computers can understand.
